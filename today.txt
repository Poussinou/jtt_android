The today list is currently a bit overcomplcated.

1. It should be similar to ClockView in that it takes a single piece of information (current hour) and fills the rest of data itself.
2. Since Service notifices Main about time changes on any important event, Today should not try and track these events itself.
3. Main would work as a proxy between Today and Service in passing the transition timestamps (TODO: timestaps should be longs).
   Alternatively, Today will have its own handler for communcation with Service. For now we'll pick the proxy way.
4. Today will completely draw itself when Main receives a MSG_HOUR event.
5. Today will keep two sync timestamps - forward and backward. Backward sync is necessary in case time goes back.
   Syncs are equal to last and next transitions. If current time falls between these two, assume that list is already in correct state.
   Otherwise check existing transitions list if it contains any useful information.
6. Fill the inner list with whatever information we have!
7. If Today doesn't have enough information about future/past transitions, it requests that information.
8. When Today gets the MSG_TRANSITIONS message, it first checks if it could use that information at all.
   Then it adds it to its transitions list. Then it adds new records to the inner list.
